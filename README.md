# Build An Alexa Skill with Kalexa-SDK - Hello World

This Alexa sample skill is a template for a simples Hello World skill using [Kalexa-SDK](https://github.com/HPInc/kalexa-sdk) library.

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end.
1. The front end is the voice interface, or VUI. The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model.
2. The back end is where the logic of your skill resides.

## Skill Setup (AWS Hosted)
In this sample skill, we will be deploying the skill to [Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda) function using 
[Amazon ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html).
